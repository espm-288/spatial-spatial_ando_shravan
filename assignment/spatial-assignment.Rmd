## Learning objectives
This module provides an introduction to the fundamentals of working with spatial vector and raster data in R while empirically exploring why systematic and structural racism is interwined with urban ecological processes. This module uses the Simple Features Access standard (ISO 19125) and tidyverse-style workflow using the sf package and emerging ecosystem of r-spatial tools.

# Exercise 
In August 2020, [Christopher Schell](http://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/cjschell) and collegues published a review in *Science* on ['The ecological and evolutionary consequences of systemic racism in urban environments'](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/12/science.aay4497) (DOI: 10.1126/science.aay4497), showing how systematic racism and classism  has significant impacts on ecological and evolutionary processes within urban environments. Here we explore a subset of the data used to support these findings in this review and the broader literature.

The [press release](https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/08/13/systemic-racism-has-consequences-for-all-life-in-cities/) on the paper is worth a read:

> “Racism is destroying our planet, and how we treat each other is essentially structural violence against our natural world,” said lead author Christopher Schell, an assistant professor of urban ecology at the University of Washington Tacoma. “Rather than just changing the conversation about how we treat each other, this paper will hopefully change the conversation about how we treat the natural world.”

In the paper, Schell writes: 

 > "In multiple cases, neighborhood racial composition can be a stronger predictor of urban socio-ecological patterns than wealth."

We are going to explore one metric for how structural racism and classism underpin landscape heterogeneity in cities.

**Figure 2** in the Schell paper shows how NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) tracks historical redlining.
![Fig. 1.](figures/fig2.png)  

We are going to recreate these city maps, and plot the distributions and mean vegetation patterns across cities to explore the structural inequality and racism that Schell et al highlight in their paper.


## Acquire redlined areas for the following cities:


```{r}

#Sf <- simple features!
birm <- sf::st_read('https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/downloads/geojson/ALBirmingham1937.geojson')
ind <- sf::st_read('https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/downloads/geojson/INIndianapolis1937.geojson')
balti <- sf::st_read('https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/downloads/geojson/MDBaltimore1937.geojson')
phoenix <- sf::st_read('https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/downloads/geojson/AZPhoenix19XX.geojson')
minn <- sf::st_read('https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/downloads/geojson/MNMinneapolis1937.geojson')
oakland <- sf::st_read('https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/downloads/geojson/CAOakland1937.geojson')
```


## Data Exploration

```{r}


#tmap interactive
tmap_mode("view")

oakland |> filter(holc_grade %in% c('D','C')) |> tm_shape() + tm_polygons("holc_grade", alpha=0.4) + tm_graticules() + tm_legend() 


tm_shape(birm) + tm_polygons("holc_grade", alpha=0.4)  + tm_graticules() +  tm_legend()
tm_shape(oakland) + tm_polygons("holc_grade", alpha=0.4) + tm_graticules() + tm_legend()

```



# Exercise 1
**Create a map which shows current (2019) mean NDVI across city redlining from the 1950s.**

## Get the NDVI data

Read in the raster files for each city that has the NDVI per pixel

```{r}


tmap_mode("plot")

birm_ndvi <- terra::rast("../data/NDVI/composite_birmingham.tif")
oakland_ndvi <- terra::rast("../data/NDVI/composite_SF.tif")
ind_ndvi <- terra::rast("../data/NDVI/composite_indianapolis.tif")
minn_ndvi <- terra::rast("../data/NDVI/composite_minneapolis.tif")
phoenix_ndvi <- terra::rast("../data/NDVI/composite_phoenix.tif")
balti_ndvi <- terra::rast("../data/NDVI/composite_baltimore.tif")


# we want to go within each redline district and add up all the NDVI data so it can be compared to other 1930s areas

```


## Function to overlay NDVI and redlined areas

This function takes in both the vector file that has the polygons for the holc grades in every city, as well as the raster files containing the NDVI for that city, and plots them overlaid in much the same way as Schell et al. 

```{r}
library(tmaptools)
tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)

Redlining_plotter <- function(city_ndvi,city_holc_polygons, city_name){
   
   #city_holc_polygons<-city_holc_polygons[st_is_valid(city_holc_polygons),]
   holc_mask <- terra::mask(x=city_ndvi, mask=vect(city_holc_polygons))

   #Separate each grade to be plotted as separate layers
   city_A <- city_holc_polygons[city_holc_polygons$holc_grade == "A",]
   city_B <- city_holc_polygons[city_holc_polygons$holc_grade == "B",]
   city_C <- city_holc_polygons[city_holc_polygons$holc_grade == "C",]
   city_D <- city_holc_polygons[city_holc_polygons$holc_grade == "D",]
   
   
   tm_shape(holc_mask, bbox = st_bbox(city_holc_polygons)) + tm_raster(palette = get_brewer_pal(palette="YlGn", n=5, plot=FALSE), title = "NDVI") +
      tm_shape(city_A) + tm_polygons(x="holc_grade", title="A",alpha=0,border.col='green', title="A")+
      tm_shape(city_B) + tm_polygons(x="holc_grade", title="B",alpha=0,border.col='blue')+
      tm_shape(city_C) + tm_polygons(x="holc_grade", title="C",alpha=0,border.col='orange')+
      tm_shape(city_D) + tm_polygons(x="holc_grade", title="D",alpha=0,border.col='red') + 
      tm_add_legend('title', 
                  	col = c('green','blue', 'orange', 'red' ),
                  	border.col = "grey40",
                  	labels = c('Grade A','Grade B','Grade C','Grade D'),
                  	title="Redlining") +
      tm_layout(main.title = city_name, title.size = 1, 
                title.position = c("center", "top"), 
                legend.outside=T, legend.position= c("right", "top"))
      
}

```

## Generate plots for each city

Call the 'Redlining_plotter' function for each city

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")

Redlining_plotter(balti_ndvi, balti, "Baltimore")
Redlining_plotter(birm_ndvi, birm, "Birmingham")
Redlining_plotter(ind_ndvi, ind, "Indianapolis")
Redlining_plotter(minn_ndvi, minn, "Minneapolis")
Redlining_plotter(oakland_ndvi, oakland, "Oakland")
Redlining_plotter(phoenix_ndvi, phoenix, "Phoenix")
```




# Exercise 2
**Plot the average NDVI values in different neighborhoods as well as the distribution of pixel values across cities and neighborhoods. Show how the trends differ between cities.**

Let's try to calculate the mean NDVI for Birmingham.

```{r}
library(knitr)

#Convert birm raster to terra land
birm_terra <- vect(birm)

#Summarize the data, i.e. within each polygon, calculate the average value of NDVI
#convert to tibble object
mean_ndvi <- terra::extract(birm_ndvi, birm_terra, mean, na.rm = T) |> as_tibble()

#Give birm a column number, and calculate 
birm_vec <- birm |> mutate(ID = 1:n(), area=st_area(geometry))

#Join birm_vec and mean_ndvi, keeping the ID, holc_grade, mean_ndvi and area
birm_final <- inner_join(mean_ndvi, birm_vec, by='ID')

#find the weighted average of NDVI values by area, for every holc_grade
birm_weighted <- birm_final |> group_by(holc_grade) |> summarize(mean_holc_ndvi = round(sum(NDVI*area) / sum(area),2) )

kable(birm_weighted)

```

## Function for NDVI distribution 

This function calculates the distribution of NDVI across different holc grade (and redlined areas)

```{r}
#Function to find the distribution of NDVI across different holc grade
#Input: A. vector / polygons corresponding to different grades (in a particular city ) - city
# B. raster of NDVI in the city with redlining - city_ndvi
#Output: Table with NDVI across holc grade

NDVI_distr_finder <- function(city,city_ndvi,city_name){
  
    
  #Some polygons have spherical geometry errors -> removing those!
  city<-city[st_is_valid(city),]
 
  #Convert birm raster to terra land
  city_terra <- vect(city)
  # city_terra
  
  #Summarize the data, i.e. within each polygon, calculate the average value of NDVI
  #convert to tibble object
  mean_ndvi <- terra::extract(city_ndvi, city_terra, mean, na.rm = T) |> as_tibble()
  
  #Give birm a column number, and calculate 
  city_vec <- city |> mutate(ID = 1:n(), area=st_area(geometry))
  
  #Join birm_vec and mean_ndvi, keeping the ID, holc_grade, mean_ndvi and area
  city_final <- inner_join(mean_ndvi, city_vec, by='ID')
  
  #find the weighted average of NDVI values by area, for every holc_grade
  city_weighted <- city_final |> 
    group_by(holc_grade) |> 
    summarize(mean_holc_ndvi = round(sum(NDVI*area) / sum(area), 2 ))

  colnames(city_weighted)[2]<- paste0(city_name,' NDVI')
  
  return(city_weighted)
  
}

```

## Derive values for all cities

```{r}
#Getting the aggregated holc grade for all cities
birm_op<-NDVI_distr_finder(birm, birm_ndvi, 'Birmingham')
oakland_op<-NDVI_distr_finder(oakland, oakland_ndvi, 'Oakland')
# phoenix_op<-NDVI_distr_finder(phoenix, phoenix_ndvi, 'Phoenix') #25 areas have issues - removing
minn_op<-NDVI_distr_finder(minn, minn_ndvi, 'Minneapolis')
ind_op<-NDVI_distr_finder(ind, ind_ndvi, 'Indianapolis')
balti_op<-NDVI_distr_finder(balti, balti_ndvi, 'Baltimore')

```

Note:
Baltimore, Minniapolis and Phoenix data had 2, 2 and 13 polygons with spherical geometry failures respectively. When generating the aggregate table, we skipped polygons with these errors.
However, over 50% (13/25 polygons) in Phoneix have spherical geometry failure errors. Since this number is non-trivial, it poses a risk in the analysis results and therefore, we have not included the aggregate NDVI numbers for Phoenix.
 


## Tabulate results

Table with NDVIs across holc grades for all cities (Except Phoenix)


```{r}
ndvi_holc_grade_agg <- cbind(birm_op,oakland_op[,2], minn_op[,2], balti_op[,2], ind_op[,2])
kable(ndvi_holc_grade_agg)
```


# Exercise 3: 
**Explain why considering systematic inequity and racism is important in the context of global change and developing solutions to the biodiversity crisis.**

1. Systemic inequity and racism with biodiversity crisis
"In the wake of the Great Depression, the federally sponsored Home Owners' Loan Corporation drew maps of neighborhoods in U.S. cities that characterized their desirability for mortgage lending. Many neighborhoods with Black and immigrant communities received the worst grade, restricting access to federally backed loans and favorable mortgage terms." [1]

We find that there is a clear difference between the mean NDVI values in the different grades (A to D) in every city we sampled. Furthermore, for certain cities such as Oakland and Baltimore, we find that there is a larger disparity in mean NDVI values in grade "D" or redlined areas that other cities.   

2. Systemic inequity and racism with pollution.
Researchers have found that these 'redlined' areas have higher levels of air pollution 80 years later. Communities of color in the United States are systematically exposed to higher levels of air pollution [1][2]

The above analysis and linked study illustrate how systemic inequity and rascism have resulted in disparate access to biodiversity and cleaner air. Therefore, in the design of solutions to mitigate the diversity loss, pollution and the like, it is critical to build a holistic solution that doesn't serve to further the inequity or access to resources but helps build a more just society.
